# Advent of Code 2023

My (potentially terrible) attempt at [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/). Given I don't know Rust that well, and this is just a bit of fun, the code quality may be sub-par.

## Running

You should have your input in the `inputs` directory, named `[daynumber].txt`. Run with `cargo run [day] [A/B]`, for example `cargo run 1 B` for the second part of day 1.
